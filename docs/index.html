The pharmacology of MTX and 6MP is complex (see figure), and we are the world-wide leading group in mapping the metabolite landscape in large clinical trials. Traditionally, MT have been adjusted by blood counts to obtain a preset degree of myelotoxicity, but this is confounded by wide natural variations in blood counts. Thus, patients are currently seen at 1-2 weeks intervals during MT to titrate therapy to the right dosage. Furthermore, methylated thiopurine metabolites can cause liver cell damage with a rise in aminotransferases (although rarely liver dysfunction; Nygaard, Clin Pharm Ther 2004). The antileukemic effect of MT is mediated by DNA-incorporated thioguanine nucleotides (DNA-TG) with on average 1:6,000 nucleotides being 6TG substituted. DNA-TG levels varies 10-fold between patients, and DNA-TG incorporation can be enhanced by other thiopurine and methotrexate metabolites. We have recently demonstrated that the risk of relapse is primarily determined by DNA-TG levels during MT (Nielsen, Lancet Oncol 2017; Toksvang, Leukemia 2021 (In press)), and that germline DNA variants determines propensity for DNA-TG incorporation (Tulstrup, Leukemia 2018). However, it frequently takes up to a year before clinicians reach the optimal dose for the individual patient, and drug dosing is determined both by the individual patient’s tolerance to the therapy and the treating physician’s willingness to adjust the treatment vigorously. Current drug dosing guidelines are based on blood counts (=degree of myelosuppression) but they do not meet the needs and patients are treated very diversely with >10-fold differences in drug doses and 40% do not reach their target degree myelosuppression, which may increase the risk of leukemic relapse. Thus, there is a profound need for AI-driven guidelines that takes into account drug metabolism (of MTX and 6MP), empiric data on drug doses and blood counts across hundreds of patients, and the individual patients treatment trajectory. Objectives of the present study: To reach a deeper understanding of interactions of these parameters as well as common host genome variants in order to facilitate drug dosing with two aims: (i) more rapidly reach the individual patient’s optimal target dose AND with fewer outpatient visits, and (ii) ultimately reduce the risk of relapse due to insufficient drug exposure.",secondary:"Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been linked to MTX and 6MP metabolism (Moriyama, Nat Genet 2016; Tulstrup, Leukemia 2018; Tulstrup, Blood 2020).
